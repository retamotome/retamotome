# Code Conduct 

## Statement for Employees  

In a for-profit organization, there exists a clear distinction from a charity or an educational institution. Employees are expected to showcase their individual value for retention, rather than depending on others to validate their worth.

### Probationary Period  

We are willing to offer an opportunity to individuals who may not have met the initial qualifications but have shown great enthusiasm and interest throughout the interview process. Our expectation is that these individuals can effectively address any skill gaps and make valuable contributions AUTONOMOUSLY during their probationary period to substantiate the claims made during their interview. There will be no initial, dummy or baseline training.    
It is important to note that if their claims are found to be unsubstantiated during the probationary review, their position will be terminated accordingly.  
  
  
## About Training
