## About Software Engineering
**Q**: How do you think if Software Engineering can make a product succeed?  
**A**: This question makes me confused.  
First, Software Engineering never guarantee the success of any software.
Second, we need a lot of other resources to make a product succeed, such as the project management, customer services, sales and global market.  
For this question, I think you might ask how Software Engineering improve a product.  
In my viewpoint, say shortly, Software Engineering is used to make communications more efficient during software development. For example, it will make the scope, flow and architecture of the software clearer, that will help engineers and programmers in development.  
However, a software might be fail even go within Software Engineering. Please refer the [UMLは手段](https://www.amazon.co.jp/UML%E3%81%AF%E6%89%8B%E6%AE%B5-%E6%8A%80%E8%A9%95SE%E6%96%B0%E6%9B%B8-005-%E8%8D%92%E4%BA%95-%E7%8E%B2%E5%AD%90/dp/4774129372/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249017737&sr=8-1) for more examples.  


**Q**: Have you ever thought about the difference between programmer and software engineer ?  
**A**: Have you ever thought ? Or did you consider both of them are creators of bugs ?  
Personally, _programmer_ is defined to be professional in programming language and its correlative tools. To illustrate, if someone said s/he is good in C++, then s/he must be familiar with STL, its issues and the work processes in difference platforms, such as Windows, Mac, SUSE, RedHat, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris. 
If someone just implements code following specification, this can be just called a _code writer_.  
  
Shortly, a code writer just care about the code can pass compiler and then work as expected.   
A programmer will enhance the program to work effectively and handle the well-known bugs comprehensively such as memory leaks.  
  
So, how about _software engineer_?   
Of course, be better than good programmers.  
A software engineer should be interested in whole system, how it works, how the modules communicate with each other, and so on. Not only care about performance and stabilization that a good programmer should do, but also security and other consequences. (This knowledge area is called as Software Engineering.)   

## About Programming
**Q**: Have you ever read some books that can improve programmers to write a good code ?  
**A**: Let me say in the cases as below :  
[1] If you mean the brainstorming like [程式之美－微軟技術面試心得](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010408182), then, I have just skimmed this book before, but I did not read in detail. And, I think most of its contents belongs in Discrete Mathematics which is one of my main university courses. If you are interested in this sort of puzzles, [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-McGraw-Hill-International/dp/0071167560/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249018295&sr=1-4) would be more amusing. This book is not only provide a lot of puzzles but also explain their concepts in detail. I think programmers should have conscientious and exact logic before considering or finding solutions. This book will help.  
I have created some puzzles, you can try one of them :  
> How will you code to round decimals to integers ?  
> How about this code : `return (int)(value + 0.5);`  
> Is this code good enough? Of course not, see [my answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJpETo_4X0c).  

[2] If you mean the skills such as [Beautiful Code](https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249019211&sr=1-1) or [Code Craft](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Craft-Practice-Writing-Excellent/dp/1593271190/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249018710&sr=1-1), I will also recommend the [Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1249018601&sr=1-1). I think this book will be helpful for upgrade a programmer to be a good software engineer.  

[3] If you mean the work environment such as [Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second/dp/0932633439#). I think this is very important for all employers and employees who really care about the quality efficiency of their companies and themselves.
